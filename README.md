Researching next-gen blockchain architecture (as of 2025) to achieve ultimate scalability in permissionless setting and
fully resolve Blockchain Trilemma. May or may not succeed but must be fun.

## Status

The current status is heavy WIP with somewhat regular updates on the [website]. Read the [book] for architecture details
and check the code for details otherwise. Most of the things are missing right now, but that'll change over time.
