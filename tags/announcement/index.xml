>initial set of constraints&lt;/a> that led to the creation of this project, but I figured it

interesting.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>There is two of us now</title><link>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-03-09-there-is-two-of-us-now/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-03-09-there-is-two-of-us-now/</guid><description>&lt;p>The big change from the last update is that &lt;a

and optimizations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Welcome!</title><link>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-01-13-welcome/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-01-13-welcome/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello, world 👋!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the beginning of hopefully successful thing I call &amp;ldquo;Project Abundance&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
