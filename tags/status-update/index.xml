expected, but still was something that I&amp;rsquo;d like to improve. So since the last update I have implemented infrastructure
for measuring performance, did a bunch of refactorings to hopefully make my work reusable by other projects in the
future, and even implemented some performance improvements with a solid idea of what to explore next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the process of doing it I ended up parsing and generating Rust code in &lt;em>both&lt;/em> &lt;code>build.rs&lt;/code> and procedural macros,
something I have never thought I&amp;rsquo;d end up doing, but let&amp;rsquo;s start from the beginning.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A year of Abundance</title><link>https://abundance.build/blog/2026-01-01-a-year-of-abundance/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://abundance.build/blog/2026-01-01-a-year-of-abundance/</guid><description>&lt;p>It has been around a year since the project started, and I would like to share a brief summary of what has happened so

exploration into how to efficiently implement it for GPU. Today I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that an initial version of that
implementation is integrated into the farmer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve tested it on both AMD and Nvidia GPUs, but in principle it should work on any Vulkan 1.2-capable GPU, which
includes both discrete and integrated graphics from something like the last decade or so. It will also run on Apple
Silicon Macs (actually tested in CI) and likely older Macs with Intel/AMD GPUs as well, though I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother verifying
it myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fact that it runs doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean it is fast, though, so the bulk of this post will be about that.&lt;/p>

A key
integration point that was missing completely and still not implemented was state management. The core parts of the
consensus do not involve state management, but transaction processing will. So I was considering various ways to process
transactions and came up with an idea I&amp;rsquo;ll be pursuing that should work nicely, but is also a bit unlike most of the
blockchains out there.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Client database prototype</title><link>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-08-01-client-database-prototype/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-08-01-client-database-prototype/</guid><description>&lt;p>The biggest update since the last blog post is that an initial prototype of the database was merged.

expiration. I think that I finally have a model with which I am comfortable with, and that I think
solves all of our previous problems. Nazar had this idea to drastically simplify how plot IDs were
derived, and how sectors were linked to plots. The high-level idea made sense, but there were still
some details that weren&amp;rsquo;t clear. This week I managed to come up with a design that I think satisfies
all of our requirements.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Simplifying Plot Expiration</title><link>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-07-07-simplifying-plot-expiration/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-07-07-simplifying-plot-expiration/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have to admit that I am a bit disappointed with my progress this week. If you recall from last
week&amp;rsquo;s update, I started the week with a base proposal to handle the linking of sectors to plots
based on history window ranges. The idea was to limit the number of parallel sectors that could be
created in parallel, linked to the same plot, and hence allocated to the same shard. While the
approach seemed quite elegant because it didn&amp;rsquo;t require any changes to how piece selection and
expiration currently works in Subspace, it turned out to be pretty complicated (even to explain) and
not the most effective solution to prevent the attack I was trying to mitigate.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Adventures with rust-gpu</title><link>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-07-02-adventures-with-rust-gpu/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-07-02-adventures-with-rust-gpu/</guid><description>&lt;p>GPU plotting was one of the items on the roadmap last week and that turned into a week+ long side quest, so let me share

detailed operation of plot membership allocation was the impact of sector expiration on the
protocol. By having a unique plot identifier, we are able to uniquely link sectors to plots, but
these sectors need to expire in a way that does not require farmers to re-plot while archiving the
most recent history. Fortunately, we can leverage the current expiration mechanism of the Subspace
protocol, and build a layer on top of it to adapt it to the sharded version while maintaining the
original guarantees in terms of plot expiration, sector re-plotting, and history archiving.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Block processing progress</title><link>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-06-23-block-processing-progress/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-06-23-block-processing-progress/</guid><description>&lt;p>This was a lighter week on meaningful changes, but there are still few things to share. First of all, last week&amp;rsquo;s block
import was (and still is) and incomplete prototype, but this week it was extended to become a bit more complete. I was
also working on bringing up more components frm Subspace, including farmer, which lead me to attempt GPU plotting in
Rust, so let&amp;rsquo;s get into it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reshuffling interval and living without fraud proofs</title><link>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-06-23-reshuffling-interval-and-living-without-fraud-proofs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-06-23-reshuffling-interval-and-living-without-fraud-proofs/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week I shared a model that can help us reason about the security of shards assuming an honest
majority in the beacon chain. The model evaluates what are the trade-offs in terms of the number of
shards, the number of farmers per shard, and the proportion of malicious farmers in the system. But
if you recall from the overall design of the system, shards are periodically submitting segments and
blocks to the upper layers of the hierarchy and to the beacon chain. We need to verify that these
are valid, available, and correctly encoded before they are included in super segments and the
global history of the system. Can we do so without relying on fraud proofs? This has been one of my
focuses for the week, let&amp;rsquo;s jump right into it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beacon chain block processing infrastructure</title><link>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-06-16-beacon-chain-block-processing-infrastructure/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-06-16-beacon-chain-block-processing-infrastructure/</guid><description>&lt;p>There was no update last week again since I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like there was enough to share at the time, but now that more
things have settled I&amp;rsquo;d like to share what I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy with.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thinking about the overall security of the system</title><link>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-06-16-thinking-about-the-overall-security-of-the-system/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-06-16-thinking-about-the-overall-security-of-the-system/</guid><description>&lt;p>This week has been all about objectively assessing the security of the system. After all of the work
around the membership allocation protocol and its security there are still two questions that we
need to answer to understand the feasibility of the protocol: (i) what is the security bound of the
protocol as a whole (from beacon chain to shards), and (ii) how can we ensure that plots are
uniquely identified and that farmers cannot cheat by committing the same plot to different history
sizes to try and game the shard allocation mechanism.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Modelling farmer membership allocation</title><link>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-06-09-modelling-farmer-membership-allocation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-06-09-modelling-farmer-membership-allocation/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week I shared a high-level of how I was thinking farmer membership selection should work. After
some discussions early in the week, we realised there were still some blind spots and attacks that
we weren&amp;rsquo;t protecting against (or if we were, we didn&amp;rsquo;t have an objective measure of how robust they
were). Thus, this week has been exclusively focused on modeling the membership selection protocol so
we can reason objectively about its design.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Membership selection and segment verification</title><link>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-06-02-membership-selection-and-segment-verification/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-06-02-membership-selection-and-segment-verification/</guid><description>&lt;p>This week has been another of those weeks where I am pretty happy with the progress made. The
highlights of the week are the following: (i) we now have a pretty good sense of the end-to-end
operation to commit shard segments into the global history of the beacon chain (as described in the
discussion of &lt;a
href="https://github.com/nazar-pc/abundance/pull/267"
target="_blank"
>PR267&lt;/a>); (ii) and Nazar had an idea
to tackle the verification of the availability and correctness of shard segments without requiring
an independent data availability mechanism, by leveraging the longest-chain rule and farmers
membership allocation (which was an issue that was really bugging me). Let&amp;rsquo;s jump into the details
of these two topics.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Path to block production and procrastination</title><link>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-06-02-path-to-block-production-and-procrastination/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-06-02-path-to-block-production-and-procrastination/</guid><description>&lt;p>There have not been an update from me last week, how come?

fleshing the low-level details for the protocol. It feels like in the past few weeks we&amp;rsquo;ve been

are getting to the point where we can start to see the details of the protocol and how it will work
in practice.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>From sharded archiving to sharded plotting</title><link>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-05-05-from-sharded-archiving-to-sharded-plotting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-05-05-from-sharded-archiving-to-sharded-plotting/</guid><description>&lt;p>We keep iterating on the best way to discuss and make progress on the design of the protocol. Using
issues for discussions have shown less efficient than originally expected. The inability to make
in-line threads, and having to quote every single detail of the spec that we want to discuss about
was really cumbersome. I started the
&lt;a
href="https://github.com/nazar-pc/abundance/issues/215"

>shard block submission issue&lt;/a> as an attempt to
start iterating the low-level details of specific protocol mechanisms in a way that is narrow enough
and easy to track, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t fulfill all our needs. The solution? Creating discussion PRs that I
don&amp;rsquo;t expect to get merged, but gives us all that we need to have low-level discussions about
specific parts of the protocol, track our progress, open ideas, and discussions, and have them
public so anyone can contribute or follow along.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Subspace codebase refactoring (part 2)</title><link>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-05-05-subspace-codebase-refactoring-part-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-05-05-subspace-codebase-refactoring-part-2/</guid><description>&lt;p>This week was very similar to the last one with a bunch of refactoring in cleanups. There were important archiver
improvements/fixes (depends on point of view) and more work on Merkle Trees. Two more crucial crates were moved from
&lt;code>subspace&lt;/code> to &lt;code>crates&lt;/code>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Proving blocks and segments</title><link>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-04-28-proving-blocks-and-segments/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-04-28-proving-blocks-and-segments/</guid><description>&lt;p>We started last week with two PRs that attempted to describe in detail the operation of sharded
archiving (&lt;a
href="https://github.com/nazar-pc/abundance/pull/192"
target="_blank"
>PR192&lt;/a>), and the data availability layer
of the system (&lt;a
href="https://github.com/nazar-pc/abundance/pull/193"
target="_blank"
>PR193&lt;/a>). When I started writing this
spec, it was meant to be for a broader audience, but we realised after a few rounds of feedback that
the project is still in a really early stage and in constant change, so it would be more efficient
to focus on detailing the parts of the protocol that are currently under-defined instead of trying
to give a deep overview of the overall operation of the protocol from the get-go. The actual goal
behind this protocol specification is to unblock the implementation of a prototype that can help us
gain certainty about the design decisions that we are making, and surface potential blind spots in
the design, and not to have a reference spec (just yet).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Subspace codebase refactoring</title><link>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-04-28-subspace-codebase-refactoring/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-04-28-subspace-codebase-refactoring/</guid><description>&lt;p>The last week was lighter on major changes, but there was a lot of cleanups and refactoring done to prepare Subspace

discussions. Now that we have a clearer direction for the design, I wanted to consolidate these
ideas into a draft spec. This will serve as a foundation for implementing the first few prototypes,
while also providing a structured way to gather feedback and uncover potential blind spots. I expect
this spec to suffer significant changes, but it felt like the perfect way to consolidate the ideas,
get feedback from the community, and unblock Nazar in case he wants to start prototyping some of the
ideas we&amp;rsquo;ve been discussing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Very fast archiving</title><link>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-04-20-very-fast-archiving/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-04-20-very-fast-archiving/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last time I mentioned that I was looking into Merkle Trees to replace KZG.

I finally have a good idea of how shard archiving
should work in the happy path, and I&amp;rsquo;ve started writing a low-level spec for it (that I am hoping to
push to this repo soon). Unfortunately, there is still a slight gap in the spec that we need to fill
before we can move forward: the &lt;em>data availability problem&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Trees everywhere</title><link>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-04-14-trees-everywhere/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-04-14-trees-everywhere/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week was lighter on code changes and more heavy on research.

schemes generally and Blake3 hash function in particular, which was already used in the codebase, but turns out can be
applied in more interesting ways than just a hash function.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Merged Farming</title><link>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-04-07-merged-farming/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-04-07-merged-farming/</guid><description>&lt;p>This week I&amp;rsquo;ve gone a bit deeper into the design of the multi-shard Subspace protocol idea which I briefly introduced in
my last update. The protocol is conformed by the following parts:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Sharded archiving, responsible for creating a global canonical history of the whole system, and of creating the
history records that will eventually become part of farmers&amp;rsquo; plots.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sharded plotting, which takes records from the global history and seals them in plots that include segments of the
history of every shard of the system, and that will be used for the farming process.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>And finally, merged farming, which is the protocol responsible for challenging farmer plots, and deriving the
corresponding winning tickets that elect block proposers in specific shards.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Let me introduce the high-level operation behind each of these sub-protocols, while digging deep in the one that I&amp;rsquo;ve
focused the most on this week: sharded archiving.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Preparing for blockchain</title><link>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-04-07-preparing-for-blockchain/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-04-07-preparing-for-blockchain/</guid><description>&lt;p>The majority of last week I spent tinkering with Subspace codebase after importing it here in preparation for building

build can be designed leveraging the current design of the Subspace protocol and all its underlying mechanisms as a
base. While this was the idea from the beginning, either for lack of familiarity with the protocol or plain ignorance, I
was missing the big picture of how this could be done.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thinking formally in terms of sidechains</title><link>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-03-24-thinking-formally-in-terms-of-sidechains/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-03-24-thinking-formally-in-terms-of-sidechains/</guid><description>&lt;p>Overall, I am really happy with the progress I&amp;rsquo;ve made this week. I&amp;rsquo;ve been mainly focused on unravelling one of the
papers that I mentioned in my last update, &lt;a
href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1239.pdf"
target="_blank"
>Proof-of-Stake Sidechains&lt;/a>. While is
true that we don&amp;rsquo;t want our system to have anything to do with PoS, and there is no 1:1 matching of the concepts from
the paper with what we are trying to build, the paper presents a framework that can come pretty handy to evaluate the
correctness of our designs. This paper is from 2018, and after a first pass the first thing that I did is to check if
there were any follow-up papers that built upon the abstractions of this paper. I came
across &lt;a
href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1048.pdf"
target="_blank"
>Proof-of-Work Sidechains&lt;/a> from the same authors, but without a doubt, the
most complete proposal is the one that I started with. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive right into it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Way faster transactions and no-panic</title><link>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-03-17-way-faster-transactions-and-no-panic/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-03-17-way-faster-transactions-and-no-panic/</guid><description>&lt;p>The plan was to get to transaction pool implementation, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t quite happen. I did a lot of investigation around
performance though. For example, transaction processing was several orders of magnitude slower than direct method calls
without a transaction, which concerned me, but after optimizations of last week the difference is ~10x. And it makes
sense given how much more work the wallet has to do on top of the method call itself.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Drawing inspiration from the Internet's architecture to scale consensus</title><link>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-03-16-drawing-inspiration-from-the-internets-architecture-to-scale-consensus/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-03-16-drawing-inspiration-from-the-internets-architecture-to-scale-consensus/</guid><description>&lt;p>I want to kick-off my first weekly update in the project thanking Nazar for the warm welcome and the opportunity to work with him on this exciting project.
