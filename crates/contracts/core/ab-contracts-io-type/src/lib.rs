// TODO: A way to point output types to input types in order to avoid unnecessary memory copy
//  (setting a pointer)
/// Trait that is used for types that are crossing host/guest boundary in contracts.
///
/// Crucially, it is implemented for any type that implements [`TrivialType`] and for
/// [`VariableBytes`](crate::variable_bytes::VariableBytes).
///
/// # Safety
/// This trait is used for types with memory transmutation capabilities, it must not be relied on
/// with untrusted data. Serializing and deserializing of types that implement this trait is simply
/// casting of underlying memory. As a result, all the types implementing this trait must not use
/// implicit padding, unions or anything similar that might make it unsound to access any bits of
/// the type.
///
/// Helper functions are provided to make casting to/from bytes a bit safer than it would otherwise,
/// but extra care is still needed.
///
/// **Do not implement this trait explicitly!** Use `#[derive(TrivialType)]` instead, which will
/// ensure safety requirements are upheld, or use `VariableBytes` if more flexibility is needed.
///
/// In case of variable state size is needed, create a wrapper struct around `VariableBytes` and
/// implement traits on it by forwarding everything to inner implementation.
