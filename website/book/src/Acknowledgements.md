# Acknowledgements

There are a lot of individuals and organizations that helped the project along the way. This page aims to have a short
high-level summary, but it is by no means exhaustive and will be expanded in the future.

* [Subspace Labs (now Autonomys Labs)] - Original research and implementation of the Subspace protocol, which is the
  foundation of the work done here. Especially research and protocol engineering teams, without which all this may have
  not been possible, you rock!
* [Subspace Foundation] - Financial and HR support for bootstrapping research and experimentation beyond original
  Subspace design, while providing complete freedom to choose what to work on. It would be much harder to make progress
  early on without this sponsorship.
* [Zulip] - Generously sponsoring free access to "Zulip Cloud Standard" plan for us and other Open Source projects.
  Zulip is an organized team chat app designed for efficient communication.
* Open Source community - Seriously, there are thousands of high-quality dependencies used effortlessly, and it would be
  physically impossible to implement all of it alone from scratch, certainly not with the same or better level of
  quality. This is a modern-day miracle that we have so much code sharing.
