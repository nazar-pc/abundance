# The list of dependencies below (which can be both direct and indirect dependencies) are crates that are suspected to
# be CPU-intensive. They are unlikely to require debugging (as some of their debug info might be missing) or to require
# to be frequently recompiled. We compile these dependencies with `opt-level=3` even in "dev" mode to make "dev" mode
# more usable.
# The majority of these crates are cryptographic libraries.
#
# This list is ordered alphabetically.
